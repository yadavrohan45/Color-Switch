# Color-Switch

In this simple Color Switch game, when you click on a button, its background color changes to a randomly selected color. The game is designed to showcase how JavaScript can be used to create interactive elements on a webpage. By incorporating event listeners and functions to generate random colors, the button dynamically changes its appearance with each click, providing an engaging user experience.
